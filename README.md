# Mu-Synthesis-Controller-Design
Designing a robust controller with the Mu synthesis method on Matlab.

Steps:
1. First download all the files.
2. Then open up the .m file with Matlab.
3. You can either use the values that are already in place for the variables or you insert your own values. (Read my research paper to see what each variable means and how the code functions https://www.academia.edu/100657726/Robust_Controllers_With_Mu_Synthesis?source=swp_share)
6. Now you are all set and ready to go!!
